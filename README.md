# discord-sms-notifications

Motivation: I used Discord for work communication once. Discord's phone notifications are very bad, so I made a script that logs into my Discord account, listens for new DM messages, and sends an SMS using Twilio API to my phone number, so that I can be properly notified on my phone.

Simple Python script using Twilio API and Discord Python library to send SMS texts to my phone on new DM messages.
